# 69. Sqrt(x)
Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
 

Example 1:
```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
 ```

Constraints:

- 0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

## Solution
```java
 public int mySqrt(int x) {
    if(x==0)
    {
      return 0;
    }
          int low=1,high=x,ans=0;
    while(low<=high)
        {
             
             int mid=(low+high)/2;
             
             if(mid<=x/mid)
             {
                 ans=mid;
                 low=mid+1;
            }
             else
             high=mid-1; 
        }
        return ans;
    }

```
