# 9. Palindrome Number

Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 ```

Constraints:

- -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
 
**Follow up:** Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

## Solution
``` java
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        int sum=0;
        int num=x;
        while(x>0)
        {
            int r = x%10;
            sum=(sum*10)+r;
            x=x/10;
        }
        if(num==sum)
        {
           return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
